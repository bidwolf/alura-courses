# Payment API

This API is a simple payment API to simulate a payment system based on the PIX.
The PIX is a Brazilian payment method that allows instant payments 24/7.
In this API, you can create a payment, get the payment details, confirm the payment, get a QR code to pay and send a notification to the client via websocket.
