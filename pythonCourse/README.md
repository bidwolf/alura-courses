## Configuration

To configure your project you can need to follow these steps:

1. init a virtual environment:
    ```shell
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

2. (OPTIONAL) if you use vscode you can press `COMMAND + SHIFT + P` then type `select interpreter` select that option and select the interpreter on `.venv` directory 
to allow the terminal to use the python created in your virtual environment.

3. read the `/requirements.txt` to install the requirements.
